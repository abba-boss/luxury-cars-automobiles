# ✅ COMPILATION ERROR FIXED!

## 🔧 **Issue Fixed:**
- **Error**: `Unexpected ":" at line 64` in AdminBookings.tsx
- **Cause**: Duplicate interface definitions causing syntax error
- **Solution**: Removed duplicate interface properties and mock data

## ✅ **What I Fixed:**
1. **Removed duplicate interface properties** (`notes` and `createdAt` were defined twice)
2. **Removed mock data** that was no longer needed
3. **Cleaned up TypeScript definitions**

## 🚀 **Status:**
- ✅ Build compiles successfully
- ✅ Frontend accessible at http://localhost:8080
- ✅ AdminBookings component loads without errors
- ✅ All TypeScript errors resolved

## 🎯 **Test Now:**
1. Go to http://localhost:8080
2. Login as admin: `admin@test.com` / `admin123`
3. Navigate to Admin → Bookings
4. You should see the booking management interface with Accept/Reject buttons

**The 500 error is now fixed and the admin booking management is working!**
